## Project Overview

`watson` is the go-to R package for modeling and analyzing axial data using the Watson distribution. It provides researchers, data scientists, and statisticians with the tools needed to:

- Simulate data from Watson distributions and their mixtures.
- Fit complex models to high-dimensional axial data.
- Accurately estimate parameters using robust numerical methods.

### Why Axial Data?
Axial data are unit vectors on a sphere where directions are indistinguishable (e.g., $x$ and $-x$ are equivalent). These data arise naturally in fields such as:

- **Structural Geology**: Modeling rock magnetism or fault planes.
- **Biostatistics**: Analyzing molecular orientations.
- **Machine Learning**: Embedding spaces and sentiment analysis.

With `watson`, you can unlock the full potential of axial data, leveraging a framework that combines theoretical results with computational power.
